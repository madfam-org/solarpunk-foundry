## 📖 About This Document
This is the **Single Source of Truth** for Innovaciones MADFAM SAS de CV. It defines our ecosystem, our strategy, and our philosophy.

* **For the Team:** This is the order of operations.
* **For the Investor:** This is how we capture value across the entire lifecycle of a product and a business.
* **For the World:** This is our roadmap to a future that makes its own things and owns its own truth.

## 🌍 I. The Vision
**"Sovereignty is not just about owning your server; it's about owning your supply chain, your money, and your mind."**

We are a **Vertically Integrated Venture Studio** bridging the gap between the Digital (Software) and the Physical (Real World).

### The Problem: The "Rented" Existence
Today, a founder is a tenant in their own business. They rent their design tools, their infrastructure, their audience, and their financial insights. A change in API pricing or a platform ban can kill a business overnight.

### The MADFAM Solution: The Sovereign Loop
We are building the **Solarpunk Foundry**. A closed-loop ecosystem where the tools support each other to create resilience.

---

## ⚙️ II. The Architecture: The "Solarpunk Stack"

Our ecosystem is organized into four biological layers. Every tool has a specific organ function.

### 🪨 Layer 1: The Soil (Infrastructure)
*The bedrock. Without this, we are tenants.*
* **🛡️ Enclii:** Our Sovereign PaaS. Bare-metal hosting. Maximum independence, minimum cost.
* **🔑 Janua:** The Gatekeeper. Identity, SSO, and Revenue Management. One key for the whole city.

### 🌿 Layer 2: The Roots (Sensing & Input)
*Absorbing nutrients (data and truth) from the outside world.*
* **🔮 Fortuna:** The Problem Hunter. Scrapes multilingual signals to find market gaps (Problem Intelligence).
* **📡 ForgeSight:** The Pricer. Scrapes global material and machine data for real-time manufacturing costs.
* **📚 BlueprintTube:** The Librarian. Indexes and rates 3D models for printability.
* **🧘 BloomScroll:** The Filter. A "Slow Web" content aggregator. 20 items/day. Serendipity over engagement.

### 🪵 Layer 3: The Stem (Core Standards & Verification)
*The structural logic that holds the system up.*
* **📐 geom-core:** The Physics Standard. C++ geometry analysis library (WASM/Python).
* **🎓 AVALA:** The Human Standard. Verification engine for applied learning (Mexico EC/CONOCER). Issues Open Badges and DC-3 forms.

### 🍎 Layer 4: The Fruit (User Platforms)
*The applications where value is created and captured.*
* **🎨 Sim4D:** The Creator. Web-based CAD guided by `geom-core`.
* **🛍️ Forj:** The Bazaar. Decentralized fabrication storefronts with NFT integration.
* **🏷️ Cotiza Studio:** The Merchant. Automated quoting engine connecting design to factory.
* **💰 Dhanam:** The Treasury. Unified budgeting and wealth tracking (Personal + Business) with ESG insights.
* **👂 Coforma Studio:** The Ear. Customer Advisory Board and feedback management.
* **⚡ Galvana:** The Reactor. Phygital Electrochemistry Platform for scientific simulation.

## 🔄 III. The "Primavera Mandate" (Dogfooding)
**"We trust it because we survive on it."**

We do not build "SaaS"; we build tools to run our own operations first.
1.  **Finance:** MADFAM runs on **Dhanam**.
2.  **Strategy:** We build what **Fortuna** validates.
3.  **Factory:** Primavera3D quotes via **Cotiza**.
4.  **Hiring:** Staff is certified via **AVALA**.
