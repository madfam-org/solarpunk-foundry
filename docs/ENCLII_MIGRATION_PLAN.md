## Migration Phases

### Phase 0: Enclii Production Readiness (Current → Week 2)
**Goal**: Get Enclii to 100% production-ready

**Remaining Tasks**:
- [ ] Run `terraform init && terraform plan` ✅ Script created
- [ ] Create Hetzner API token
- [ ] Create Cloudflare API token (Zone:Edit, Tunnel:Edit, R2:Edit)
- [ ] Create R2 API credentials
- [ ] Generate JWT signing keys for Janua
- [ ] Configure SMTP for Janua email
- [ ] Run `terraform apply` to provision infrastructure
- [ ] Deploy k8s resources: `kubectl apply -k infra/k8s/production`
- [ ] Verify all health checks pass

**Validation Criteria**:
- Switchyard API responding at api.enclii.dev
- Switchyard UI accessible at app.enclii.dev
- Janua OAuth flow working at auth.enclii.dev
- Redis Sentinel failover tested
- R2 storage accessible

---

### Phase 1: Dogfooding Services (Weeks 3-4)
**Goal**: Deploy Enclii's own services on Enclii

**Services**:
1. **switchyard-api** → api.enclii.dev ✅ Spec exists
2. **switchyard-ui** → app.enclii.dev ✅ Spec exists
3. **janua** → auth.enclii.dev ✅ Spec exists
4. **landing-page** → enclii.dev ✅ Spec exists
5. **docs-site** → docs.enclii.dev ✅ Spec exists
6. **status-page** → status.enclii.dev ✅ Spec exists

**Validation Criteria**:
- All 6 services deployed and healthy
- OAuth login working end-to-end
- Metrics visible in Grafana
- Alerts configured and tested

---

### Phase 2: Low-Risk Migrations (Weeks 5-6)
**Goal**: Migrate non-critical and new services

**Services** (in order):
1. **forgesight-api** → api.forgesight.quest ✅ Spec created
2. **forgesight-web** → www.forgesight.quest ✅ Spec created
3. **electrochem-sim** → galvana.io (new deployment)
4. **primavera3d** → primavera3d.com (new deployment)

**Migration Pattern**:
```
1. Create Enclii service spec
2. Deploy to Enclii (staging subdomain)
3. Run integration tests
4. DNS cutover (5-minute TTL first)
5. Monitor for 24h
6. Decommission old deployment
```

**Rollback Plan**:
- Keep old deployment running for 7 days
- DNS revert takes <5 minutes
- Database remains unchanged (connection string update only)

---

### Phase 3: Production Migrations (Weeks 7-10)
**Goal**: Migrate production revenue-generating services

**Services** (in order of risk):
1. **aureo-labs** → aureo.labs (business site, low traffic)
2. **madfam-site** → madfam.io (corporate site)
3. **digifab-quoting** → api.cotiza.studio (production SaaS)
4. **sim4d** → sim4d.io (CAD app)

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Blue-green deployment for zero downtime
- Canary releases (10% → 50% → 100%)
- Database connection pooling maintained
- Feature flags for gradual rollout

**Validation Criteria per Service**:
- [ ] All E2E tests passing
- [ ] Performance within 10% of baseline
- [ ] Error rate < 0.1%
- [ ] All monitoring alerts green
- [ ] Customer-facing functionality verified

---

### Phase 4: New Service Deployments (Weeks 11-12)
**Goal**: Deploy new services directly to Enclii

**Services**:
1. **dhanam-api** → api.dhanam.app
2. **dhanam-web** → dhanam.app
3. **fortuna-api** → api.fortuna.quest
4. **forj** → forj.io

---

### Phase 5: Cleanup & Optimization (Week 13+)
**Goal**: Decommission old infrastructure

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Cancel Vercel Pro subscription
- [ ] Cancel Railway subscription
- [ ] Archive old deployment configs
- [ ] Update all documentation
- [ ] Conduct cost review
- [ ] Performance optimization pass

---

## Service Specification Template

Each service needs an Enclii spec in `/enclii/dogfooding/`. Template:

```yaml
apiVersion: enclii.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: service-name
  project: aureo-labs  # or madfam, primavera3d
  labels:
    app: app-name
    component: api|web|worker
    tier: production|staging

spec:
  build:
    source:
      repo: github.com/madfam-org/repo-name
      branch: main
      path: services/api  # if monorepo
    builder: dockerfile|nixpacks
    
  runtime:
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 200m
        memory: 512Mi
      limits:
        cpu: 1000m
        memory: 2Gi
    replicas:
      min: 2
      max: 10
    healthCheck:
      liveness:
        path: /health
        port: 8000
      readiness:
        path: /health/ready
        port: 8000

  networking:
    port: 8000
    domains:
      - api.example.com
    tls:
      enabled: true
      provider: cloudflare

  env:
    NODE_ENV: production
    # ... service-specific vars

  secrets:
    - name: DATABASE_URL
      key: service/database-url

  deployment:
    strategy: canary
```

---

## Domain Migration Checklist

For each domain migration:

- [ ] Set DNS TTL to 300 (5 minutes) 48h before migration
- [ ] Create Enclii service with staging domain
- [ ] Verify staging deployment works
- [ ] Create Cloudflare Tunnel route for production domain
- [ ] Update DNS to point to Cloudflare (if not already)
- [ ] Verify TLS certificate issued
- [ ] Monitor error rates for 1 hour
- [ ] Restore DNS TTL to 3600 (1 hour)
- [ ] Keep old deployment for 7 days as backup

---

## Database Strategy

### Shared PostgreSQL (Recommended for MVP)
All services share single Ubicloud PostgreSQL instance with:
- Separate databases per service
- Connection pooling via PgBouncer
- Automatic backups to R2

### Per-Service Databases (Enterprise)
For isolation requirements:
- Dedicated PostgreSQL per service
- Higher cost (~$50/service/month)
- Stronger compliance posture

### Migration Steps
1. Services already use Railway PostgreSQL → Export data
2. Import to Ubicloud PostgreSQL
3. Update DATABASE_URL secret in Enclii
4. Verify connectivity and performance
5. Deprecate Railway database

---

## Authentication Migration

### Current State
- Various JWT implementations across services
- Some use NextAuth
- No centralized auth

### Target State
- All services authenticate via Janua
- Single OAuth/OIDC provider
- Unified user management

### Migration Path
1. Deploy Janua on Enclii
2. Create OAuth clients for each service
3. Update service auth configs to use Janua JWKS
4. Migrate user accounts (gradual, with dual-auth support)
5. Deprecate old auth implementations

## Cost Tracking

### Before Migration (Monthly)
| Service | Platform | Cost |
|---------|----------|------|
| Vercel Pro | Vercel | $20 |
| Railway Hobby | Railway | $5 |
| Railway Pro (when needed) | Railway | $20+ |
| Auth0 (if used) | Auth0 | $220+ |
| **Estimated Total** | | **$265+** |

### After Migration (Monthly)
| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| Hetzner (3x CPX31) | $45 |
| Ubicloud PostgreSQL | $50 |
| Cloudflare R2 | $5 |
| Cloudflare (tunnel, DNS) | $0 |
| **Total** | **$100** |

### Savings
- **Monthly**: $165+ (62% reduction)
- **Annual**: $1,980+
- **5-Year**: $9,900+ (conservative)

*Note: With Railway Pro + Auth0, savings are $127,200+ over 5 years*

|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Enclii bugs affect all services | Medium | High | Staged rollout, monitoring |
| DNS propagation delays | Low | Medium | Low TTL, Cloudflare |
| Database migration data loss | Low | Critical | Backups, dry-run first |
| Performance regression | Medium | Medium | Baseline metrics, canary |
| Team unfamiliarity with Enclii | High | Low | Documentation, training |
