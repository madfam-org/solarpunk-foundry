# Every third-party `uses:` must name an immutable 40-hex commit SHA.
#
# WHY. `@main` and `@v4` are mutable refs. `templates/ci/README.md` instructed
# every madfam-org repo to consume this repository's actions at `@main`, so
# anyone who could push to this repo's main branch executed code inside every
# consumer's CI -- including `npm-madfam-auth`, which is handed
# `secrets.NPM_MADFAM_TOKEN`. A tag is no better: tags move.
#
# Local `./`-relative uses are exempt: they resolve inside the same checkout, so
# there is no third party and nothing to pin.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  every non-local `uses:` is SHA-pinned
#   1  at least one mutable ref
#   2  UNDETERMINED -- no files to scan, or no `uses:` found at all, which means
#      the scan was misconfigured rather than clean.

Action pin check failed. Pin by SHA:

  uses: owner/action@<40-hex-sha>  # v1.2.3

`@main` gives every pusher to that branch execution inside this repository's CI,
with this repository's secrets. `@v4` is a tag, and tags move. The trailing
comment is what tells a reader how stale the pin is; Dependabot
(.github/dependabot.yml) keeps both the SHA and the comment current.
